# calculator

My take at TOP's calculator project!
As this is the final project of the Foundations course, I made extra effort to display all the HTMl, CSS, and JS skills I have learned so far. My calculator has additional clear, delete, plus/minus sign and decimal options on top of all the basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
